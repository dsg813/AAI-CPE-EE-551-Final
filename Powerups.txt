make a counter for number of erased blocks, and number of white blocks coming soon

each level increases the number of colors by 1 (from 2 to 7 (maybe more?))

points are earned based on number of blocks it takes to get the clear. (golf points style)
powerups activate automatically

make animations for cool stuff happening
